# WebDashboard
The purpose of this project is to gain insights into the agricultural market data of different commodities, e.g., Wheat, Corn, Barley, Oats etc. and present them in a dashboard. The data includes different attributes such as consumption, production, import, export, stocks, yield of the commodities. The data reports attributes on 125 countries and over 20 years timeline.

• This project is developed using bootstrap 4.<br>
• The UI supports responsive layouts.<br>
• For developing the visualizations, PSD Grain Data_small.xlsx has been used. <br>
• For keeping the project simple, only "Wheat" from country "Canada" has been used for the calculations of the timeseries, barplot, crosstab, and pack layout graphs. <br>
• The visualizations have been developed using chart.js and d3.js. <br>
• The color palettes of the visualizations are carefully chosen to support color-blind users. <br>
